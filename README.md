# NAPALM
Using NAPALM to get information from network devices

NAPALM is another powerful network automation Python library. It's main benefit is it can retrieve information from 
a multi-vendor environment and act as a unified interface between the programmer and network devices.

I used NAPALM to retrieve information from the device in a JSON format.
